# Four in a Row Game

## Overview
This is a simple console-based implementation of the classic game "Four in a Row" (also known as Connect Four). The game allows two players to take turns placing their tokens ('X' and 'O') in a grid with the goal of getting four of their tokens consecutively in a row, column, or diagonal.

## Features
- Two-player gameplay: Play against a friend on the same computer.
- Colorful grid representation: The game grid is displayed in the console with colorful tokens for better visualization.
- Input validation: The program ensures that players enter valid column choices and prevents them from placing tokens in full columns.

## How to Play
1. Run the program in a Java-supported environment.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to take turns placing your tokens.
3. Enter the column letter (A-G) where you want to drop your token.
4. The game ends when one player achieves four tokens in a row, column, or diagonal, or when the grid is full and no more moves can be made.
5. At the end of the game, you can choose to play again or exit the program.
